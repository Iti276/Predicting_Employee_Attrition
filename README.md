# HR Attrition Analysis

# HR Analytics: Attrition Prediction Model

## Introduction
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict employee attrition, thereby enabling HR teams to implement strategic interventions for enhanced retention. This repository contains the data, scripts, and documentation for building and evaluating several predictive models.


## Dataset
The dataset used, `Assignment1Dataset_v0.1.csv`, includes 15 variables such as Age, Gender, Education Level, Salary, and many more that are linked to employee attrition. This dataset allows for comprehensive data-driven insights into factors contributing to employee turnover.

## Project Structure

- **Data Exploration and Visualization**: Detailed visual analysis of variables to understand their impact on attrition.
- **Data Wrangling**: Preparation and cleansing of data to make it suitable for modeling.
- **Model Development and Evaluation**: Building and tuning of models like Random Forest and SVM to predict attrition.
- **Comparison of Models**: Evaluating different models to understand their performance and effectiveness.
- **Recommendations for Improvement**: Suggestions on enhancing model performance using advanced techniques.


### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
### Results
My analysis indicates that the model can predict employee attrition with an accuracy of 85%. Detailed performance metrics are included within the python file.

### Conclusion
The model developed through this project provides actionable insights into employee turnover, facilitating strategic decisions aimed at improving retention rates. Ongoing refinement and integration of new data and techniques are recommended to maintain and enhance the model's accuracy.
